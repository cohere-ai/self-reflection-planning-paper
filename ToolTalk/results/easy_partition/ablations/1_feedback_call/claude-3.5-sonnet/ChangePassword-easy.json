I asked for your current password because it's typically required to change a password for security reasons. However, I should have explained the process more clearly. Let me break it down for you:\n\n1. To change your password, you'll need to provide your current password. This is a security measure to ensure that only the account owner can make such changes.\n\n2. Then, you'll need to provide a new password of your choice.\n\n3. The system will then update your password to the new one you've chosen.\n\nThis process is done to protect your account from unauthorized changes. I won't actually see or store your password; it will be processed securely by the system.\n\nWould you like to proceed with changing your password? If so, I can guide you through the process using the appropriate tool, but I'll need you to input your current password and desired new password when prompted. Is that okay with you?\"\"",
