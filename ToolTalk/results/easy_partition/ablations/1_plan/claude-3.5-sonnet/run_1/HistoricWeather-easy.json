According to the current weather information for London, it's not over 100 degrees today. Let me provide you with the accurate information:\n\n1. Current weather in London:\n   - Date: 2023-09-11 (today)\n   - High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\n2. Historic weather for London in September:\n   - Average maximum temperature: 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - Average minimum temperature: 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n   - Record low temperature: 40\u00b0F (about 4\u00b0C)\n\nTo answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London, and it's actually not over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) today. The current high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warmer than the average September high of 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C), but it's still well below 100\u00b0F.\n\nIt's worth noting that the temperature you're experiencing (80\u00b0F) is above average for September in London, which might explain why it feels particularly warm to you. However, it's not close to 100\u00b0F, which would be extremely unusual for London at any time of year.\n\nIf you're feeling much hotter than the reported temperature, it could be due to factors like:\n1. Humidity, which can make it feel warmer than the actual temperature\n2. Urban heat island effect, where cities can be warmer than surrounding areas\n3. Your personal heat tolerance or acclimatization\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
