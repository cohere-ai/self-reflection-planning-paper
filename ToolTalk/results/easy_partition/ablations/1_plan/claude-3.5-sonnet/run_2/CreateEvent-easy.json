Before we proceed, I checked your calendar for Friday (assuming it's this coming Friday, September 15th, 2023), and it appears you don't have any other events scheduled for that day. Let's go ahead and create the event for you.\n\nTo create this event, I'll need some more information from you:\n\n1. What time does the concert start?\n2. How long do you expect the concert to last? (This will help us set an end time)\n3. Where is the concert taking place?\n4. Would you like to add any additional details or description to the event?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can create the event for you using the CreateEvent tool.
