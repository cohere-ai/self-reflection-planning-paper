                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a discrepancy between your perception of the temperature and the actual weather data. According to the current weather information for London, it's not over 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) today. The current high temperature is actually 80\u00b0F (26.7\u00b0C), which is warm but not extremely hot.\n\nTo answer your question about whether it's normally this hot in London:\n\n1. Today's high of 80\u00b0F (26.7\u00b0C) is indeed warmer than usual for September in London.\n2. The historic weather data for September in London shows:\n   - Average maximum temperature: 66\u00b0F (18.9\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (31.7\u00b0C)\n\nSo, while today is warmer than average, it's not breaking any records. It's about 14\u00b0F (7.8\u00b0C) above the typical September high, but still 9\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) below the record high for the month.\n\nIt's worth noting that temperatures over 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) are extremely rare in London. The city's all-time record high temperature is 104.4\u00b0F (40.2\u00b0C), which was recorded in July 2022 during an exceptional heatwave.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly hot today, it could be due to factors like humidity, lack of wind, or being in an area with less air circulation (like a city center with lots of buildings). Also, personal perception of temperature can vary based on what you're used to or your current activity level.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
