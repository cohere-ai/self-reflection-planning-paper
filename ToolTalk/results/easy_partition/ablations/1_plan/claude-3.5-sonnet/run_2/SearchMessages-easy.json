First, I searched for messages containing \"new project\" from last week (September 4th to September 11th), but no results were found.\n2. Then, I broadened the search by removing the date range, still looking for \"new project\", but again, no results were found.\n3. I also checked your account information to make sure we were searching the correct account.\n\nSince we couldn't find the specific message, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. The message might not contain the exact phrase \"new project\". Can you remember any other keywords or phrases that might have been used?\n2. It's possible the message was sent earlier than last week. Would you like me to expand the search to include a broader time range?\n3. Do you remember who specifically sent the message? If you can provide their username, we can narrow down the search to messages from that person.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to try any of these options or if you have any other details that might help in finding the message.",
