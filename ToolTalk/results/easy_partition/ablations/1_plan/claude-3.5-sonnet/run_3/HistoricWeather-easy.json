According to the current weather data, the high temperature in London today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\"\n\nWhile 80\u00b0F is warm for London, it's not over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) as you mentioned. In fact, it's quite unusual for London to reach temperatures that high. Let me provide some context based on the historical weather data for September in London:\n\n1. The average high temperature in September ranges from 55\u00b0F to 66\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C to 19\u00b0C).\n2. The record high temperature for September in London is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C).\n\nSo, today's temperature of 80\u00b0F is indeed above average for September in London, but it's not as extreme as you perceived. It's warm, but not unusually hot for the hottest days London can experience.\n\nTo answer your question directly: No, it's not normally this hot in London, especially not over 100\u00b0F. Today's temperature is above average but still within the realm of what London occasionally experiences in warmer periods. The temperature you're feeling might be exacerbated by factors like humidity, lack of air conditioning (which is less common in London than in some other cities), or urban heat island effects.\n\nIf you're feeling uncomfortably warm, here are a few tips to stay cool:\n1. Stay hydrated\n2. Seek shade or air-conditioned spaces\n3. Wear light, breathable clothing\n4. Avoid strenuous activities during the hottest parts of the day\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
