However, for security reasons, I can't know or see your current password, and I shouldn't suggest a new password for you. Instead, I'll guide you through the process.\n\nTo change your password, you'll need to provide your current password and your desired new password. Please enter them in the following format:\n\nold_password: [Your current password]\nnew_password: [Your desired new password]\n\nMake sure your new password is strong and secure. It should be at least 8 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\nOnce you provide this information, I'll be able to help you change your password using the ChangePassword tool.",
