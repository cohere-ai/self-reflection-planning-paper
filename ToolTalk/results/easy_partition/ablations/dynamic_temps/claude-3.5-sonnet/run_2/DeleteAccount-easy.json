Before we proceed with that, I'd like to confirm a few details and guide you through the process. Here's a plan to help you delete your account:\n\nStep 1: Confirm the account information\n#V1 = GetAccountInformation()\n\nStep 2: Inform the user about the account deletion process\n#V2 = Provide information about account deletion\n\nStep 3: Request confirmation and password for account deletion\n#V3 = Ask for confirmation and password\n\nStep 4: Delete the account\n#V4 = DeleteAccount(password)\n\nLet's start with Step 1, which we've already completed. Your account information is as follows:\nUsername: ahhchiu\nEmail: k.chiu@taoxi.edu\nPhone: 806-361-3049\nName: Kong Chiu\n\nNow, for Step 2, I want to inform you about the account deletion process:\n- Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.\n- All your data, including emails, messages, calendar events, and reminders, will be permanently deleted.\n- You won't be able to recover this information once the account is deleted.\n- If you change your mind in the future, you'll need to create a new account.\n\nFor Step 3, I need to ask: Are you absolutely sure you want to delete your account? If yes, please provide your password so we can proceed with the deletion.",
