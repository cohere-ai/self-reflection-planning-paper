Let me provide you with the correct information and then we can look into whether this is normal for London.\n\nThe current weather in London shows:\n- High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n- Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n- Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\nThis is significantly cooler than the over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) you mentioned. It's possible you might be feeling warmer due to other factors like humidity or lack of air circulation, but the actual temperature is much lower.\n\nTo answer your question about whether this is normal for London, we should look at the historical weather data for this time of year. Let's check that now.\n\n",

                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a discrepancy between your perception of the temperature and the actual weather conditions in London today. According to the current weather data, it's not over 100\u00b0F (which would be extremely unusual for London). Let me provide you with the accurate information:\n\n1. Current weather in London:\n   - Date: 2023-09-11 (today)\n   - High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\n2. Historic weather for September in London:\n   - Average maximum temperature: 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - Average minimum temperature: 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n   - Record low temperature: 40\u00b0F (about 4\u00b0C)\n\nTo answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London, but it's also not as hot as you perceived. Today's high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warmer than the average September high of 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C), but it's still well below 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C).\n\nThe current temperature is higher than average for September, but it's within the normal range of variation. It's actually about 14\u00b0F (8\u00b0C) above the average September high, which could explain why it feels unusually warm to you.\n\nIt's worth noting that temperatures over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) are extremely rare in London. The highest temperature ever recorded in London was 104.5\u00b0F (40.3\u00b0C) in July 2022, which was an exceptional heatwave.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly hot, it might be due to factors like humidity, lack of air conditioning (which is less common in London than in some other parts of the world), or coming from a cooler climate. Remember to stay hydrated and seek shade or cool areas if you're feeling uncomfortable in the warm weather.",
