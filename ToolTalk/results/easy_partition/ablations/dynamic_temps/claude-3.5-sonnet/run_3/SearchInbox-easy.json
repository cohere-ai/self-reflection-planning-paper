There are no emails from John in your recent inbox (remember, the search only returns the 5 most recent results).\n2. The sender's email address might not contain \"John\" directly.\n3. You might not be logged in, which is necessary to access your inbox.\n\nTo help you better, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Are you sure you're logged in to your account?\n2. Do you know John's full email address? It might be helpful to search using his complete email address instead of just his name.\n3. Would you like to try searching with different criteria, such as a specific subject or date range?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll be happy to help you further.",
