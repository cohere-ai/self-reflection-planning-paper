Let me clarify the situation based on the information I've gathered:\n\n1. Current Weather: According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\"\n\n2. Historical Weather: Looking at the historical weather data for September in London, we can see that:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - The average minimum temperature is around 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nGiven this information, I can address your question:\n\nIt's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) in London today. The current high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warmer than the average September high of 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C), but it's not unusually extreme. It's well below the record high of 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) for September.\n\nWhile it might feel quite warm compared to what you're used to, especially if you're from a cooler climate, it's not as hot as you initially thought. The \"over 100\" temperature you mentioned would be extremely unusual for London, even during the hottest months.\n\nLondon generally has a temperate climate with mild temperatures. Days over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) are extremely rare in London and would be considered exceptional weather events.\n\nIs it possible you might be feeling the heat more due to other factors, such as humidity or lack of air conditioning, which is less common in London than in some other parts of the world? Or perhaps there was a misreading of a thermometer or weather report?",
