                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a discrepancy between your perception of the temperature and the actual weather conditions in London. Let me clarify the situation for you:\n\n1. Current weather: According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy\".\n\n2. Historical weather: Looking at the historical weather data for September in London, we can see that:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - The average minimum temperature is around 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nGiven this information, I can address your question:\n\n1. It's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) today in London. The current high is 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C), which is warm for London but not as extreme as you perceived.\n\n2. Today's temperature (80\u00b0F/27\u00b0C) is indeed higher than normal for September in London. It's about 14\u00b0F (8\u00b0C) above the average maximum temperature for this month.\n\n3. While it's warmer than usual, it's not unprecedented. The record high for September in London is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C), so today's temperature, while high, is not breaking records.\n\nIt's possible that factors like humidity, direct sunlight, or urban heat island effects might be making it feel hotter than the actual temperature. Also, if you're not used to London's climate, 80\u00b0F might feel quite hot compared to what you're expecting.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
