Before proceeding with the account deletion, I'd like to confirm a few details and guide you through the process. Here's a plan to help you delete your account:\n\nStep 1: Confirm user identity and account information\n#V1 = GetAccountInformation()\n\nStep 2: Inform the user about the account deletion process and ask for confirmation\n#V2 = User confirmation (no tool used)\n\nStep 3: Delete the account\n#V3 = DeleteAccount(password)\n\nStep 4: Log the user out\n#V4 = LogoutUser()\n\nNow, let's proceed with the plan:\n\nStep 1: I've already retrieved your account information. Your username is ahhchiu, and your email is k.chiu@taoxi.edu.\n\nStep 2: Before we proceed with deleting your account, I want to make sure you understand that this action is irreversible. Once your account is deleted, you won't be able to recover any of your data or settings. Are you sure you want to proceed with deleting your account?
