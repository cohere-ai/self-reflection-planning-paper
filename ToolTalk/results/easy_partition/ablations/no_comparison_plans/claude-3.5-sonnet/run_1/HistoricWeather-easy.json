According to the current weather information for London, it's not over 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) today. Let me provide you with the accurate information:\n\n1. Current weather in London:\n   - Date: 2023-09-11 (today)\n   - High: 80\u00b0F (about 26.7\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 56\u00b0F (about 13.3\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\n2. Historic weather for London in September:\n   - Average maximum temperature: 66\u00b0F (about 18.9\u00b0C)\n   - Average minimum temperature: 55\u00b0F (about 12.8\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (about 31.7\u00b0C)\n\nBased on this information, today's high of 80\u00b0F (26.7\u00b0C) is actually warmer than the average September high of 66\u00b0F (18.9\u00b0C), but it's not as extreme as you perceived. It's certainly not over 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C).\n\nTo answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London, especially not over 100\u00b0F. Today's temperature is above average for September, but it's still within the normal range of variation. The record high for September in London is 89\u00b0F (31.7\u00b0C), which is significantly lower than 100\u00b0F.\n\nIt's possible that factors like humidity, direct sunlight, or urban heat island effects might be making it feel hotter than the actual temperature. Also, if you're not used to temperatures in Fahrenheit, there might be some confusion with the scale (80\u00b0F might feel quite warm if you're used to Celsius).\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
