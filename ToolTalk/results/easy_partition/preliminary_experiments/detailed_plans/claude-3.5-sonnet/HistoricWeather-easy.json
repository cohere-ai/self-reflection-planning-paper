According to the current weather information for London, it's not over 100 degrees today. The current high temperature is 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), which is warm but not extremely hot.\n\nTo answer your question about whether it's normally this hot in London:\n\n1. The current high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is actually warmer than usual for September in London.\n2. According to the historical weather data for September in London:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n\nSo while today is warmer than average, it's not unprecedented. It's above the typical September temperatures but below the record high for the month.\n\nIt's worth noting that temperatures over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) are extremely rare in London. The city has a temperate climate and such high temperatures would be considered exceptional.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly hot today, it could be due to factors like humidity, lack of air circulation, or being in an area that retains heat (like a city center with lots of buildings and pavement). Also, personal perception of temperature can vary based on what you're accustomed to.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
