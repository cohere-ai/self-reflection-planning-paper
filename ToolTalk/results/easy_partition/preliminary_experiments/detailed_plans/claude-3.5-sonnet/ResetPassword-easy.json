Let me outline a plan to complete this task securely.\n\nStep 1: Generate a strong password suggestion\nFor this step, I'll create a strong password suggestion. As an AI, I can generate a random, secure password for you. Let's use the following:\n\nSuggested password: \"Zx9#mK2pL@q7\"\n\nThis password is strong because it:\n- Is 12 characters long\n- Contains uppercase and lowercase letters\n- Includes numbers\n- Has special characters\n- Is randomly generated, making it difficult to guess\n\nStep 2: Confirm the username associated with the verification code\n#V1 = QueryUser(email=\"\")\n\nStep 3: Reset the password using the verification code and new password\n#V2 = ResetPassword(username=\"#V1\", verification_code=\"982003\", new_password=\"Zx9#mK2pL@q7\")\n\nNow, let me explain this plan to you:\n\n1. I've suggested a strong password for you to use.\n2. We need to confirm your username, as it's required for the password reset process. I'll need to query your account using your email address.\n3. Once we have your username, we can proceed with resetting your password using the verification code you received and the new password I suggested.\n\nBefore we proceed, I need to ask you a couple of questions:\n\n1. Are you comfortable with using the password I suggested (\"Zx9#mK2pL@q7\"), or would you prefer a different one?\n2. Can you provide the email address associated with your account so I can look up your username?\n\nOnce you provide this information, we can move forward with resetting your password.",
