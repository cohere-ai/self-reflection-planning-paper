Let's try a different approach to locate the message you're looking for.\n\nTo help you find the message from your boss about the new project, I'd like to ask a few questions:\n\n1. Do you remember any specific keywords or phrases that were used in the message, other than \"new project\"?\n2. Do you know your boss's username in the messaging system?\n3. Can you recall if the message was sent earlier than last week? It's possible it might have been sent earlier than we initially searched for.\n\nOnce you provide this information, we can perform a more targeted search to find the message you're looking for.",
