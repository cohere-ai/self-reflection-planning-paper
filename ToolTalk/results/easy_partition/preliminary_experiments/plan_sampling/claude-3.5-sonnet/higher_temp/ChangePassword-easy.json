It's a security measure to ensure that only the rightful account owner can change the password. Here's why it's necessary:\n\n1. Security verification: The current password acts as a verification that you are the authorized user of the account.\n\n2. Prevent unauthorized changes: It stops someone else from changing your password if they somehow gained temporary access to your logged-in session.\n\n3. Standard practice: This is a common security practice in most systems to protect user accounts.\n\nTo change your password, we'll need to use the ChangePassword tool, which requires both your old (current) password and the new password you want to set. \n\nIf you're comfortable proceeding, please provide your current password, and then we can move on to setting your new password. If you're not comfortable sharing your current password here, that's completely understandable. In that case, you might want to change your password through the application's official interface where you can input the passwords directly without sharing them with an assistant.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the password change process?",
