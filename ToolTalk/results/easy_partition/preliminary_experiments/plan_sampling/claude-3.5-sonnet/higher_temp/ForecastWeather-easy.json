The third day (September 14): 30% chance of rain\n\nSo, while there's a good chance of rain for the next two days, the probability decreases on the third day. Unfortunately, the forecast tool only provides information for the next three days, so I can't tell you with certainty what will happen beyond September 14. \n\nIt's worth noting that the chance of rain decreases significantly on the third day, so there's a possibility that the rainy period might be coming to an end by then. However, weather can be unpredictable, especially in London, so it's always a good idea to check for updates closer to the time.\n\nWould you like any more specific information about the forecast, such as temperatures or any other weather-related questions?",
