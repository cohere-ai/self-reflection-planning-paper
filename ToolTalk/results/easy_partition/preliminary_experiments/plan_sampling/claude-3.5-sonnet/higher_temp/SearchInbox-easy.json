There might be emails from John, but they're older and not in the most recent results.\n\nTo help you better, I can try a few more things:\n\n1. We could search for emails using just \"John\" as a keyword, in case his email address is different.\n2. We could expand the search to include older emails.\n3. If you know John's full email address, we could search using that specific address.\n\nWhat would you like me to do next?
