If you're experiencing issues with the service, is there anything specific we can help you with before taking this drastic step?\n\n3. Would you like to provide any feedback about what aspects of the service you find unsatisfactory? This could help improve the service for others.\n\nIf you still wish to proceed with account deletion after considering these points, please confirm, and I'll guide you through the process.
