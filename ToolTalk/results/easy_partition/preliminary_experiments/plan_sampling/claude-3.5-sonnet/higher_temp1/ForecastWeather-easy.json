The temperature will be mild, with a high of 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) and a low of 61\u00b0F (16\u00b0C). It would be a good idea to be prepared for potential rain and dress in layers to accommodate the temperature range.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather or any other information I can help you with?",

Let me break that down for you:\n\n1. Tomorrow (September 12, 2023):\n   - High: 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 61\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 60% chance of rain\n\n2. The day after tomorrow (September 13, 2023):\n   - High: 67\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 60% chance of rain\n\n3. Two days from tomorrow (September 14, 2023):\n   - High: 67\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 53\u00b0F (12\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 30% chance of rain\n\nBased on this forecast, it looks like the rain is likely to continue for at least two days (September 12 and 13) with a 60% chance each day. On the third day (September 14), the chance of rain decreases to 30%, indicating that the weather might start to clear up.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: The higher chance of rain (60%) is expected to last for at least two days. After that, there's still a possibility of rain, but it's less likely.\n\nKeep in mind that weather forecasts can change, so it might be a good idea to check again closer to the date if you have any outdoor plans. Would you like any more information about the weather or anything else?",
