According to the current weather data I just retrieved, it's not actually over 100 degrees today in London. Let me provide you with the accurate information and then address your question about whether it's normally this hot.\n\nThe current weather in London shows:\n- Date: 2023-09-11 (today)\n- High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n- Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n- Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\nThis is quite different from the over 100 degrees you mentioned. In fact, 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is considered warm for London, but not exceptionally hot.\n\nTo answer your question about whether it's normally this hot in London, we need to look at historical weather data. Let's check the historical weather for September in London.\n\n",

                    "text": "\n\nI apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in your perception of the current temperature. According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), which is warm but not over 100\u00b0F as you mentioned. The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\"\n\nTo address your question about whether it's normally this hot in London:\n\n1. Today's high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is indeed warmer than usual for September in London.\n\n2. According to the historic weather data for September in London:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n\nSo, while today is warmer than average, it's not unprecedented. It's about 14\u00b0F (8\u00b0C) above the typical September high, but still below the record high for the month.\n\nIt's worth noting that London, like many places, can experience temperature variations and occasional heat waves. However, temperatures over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) are extremely rare in London and would be considered exceptional.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly hot today, it might be due to factors like humidity, lack of wind, or being in an area with less shade or more heat-retaining surfaces (like concrete in urban areas). Remember to stay hydrated and seek cool areas if you're uncomfortable in the heat.",
