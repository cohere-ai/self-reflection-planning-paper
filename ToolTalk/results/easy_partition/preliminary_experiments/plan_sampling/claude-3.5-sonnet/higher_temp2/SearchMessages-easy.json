The message might not contain the keywords we searched for.\n4. There might be an issue with the message retrieval system.\n\nTo help you find the message, I suggest we try a few more approaches:\n\n1. Can you provide the actual username or email address of your boss? This will help us search more accurately.\n2. Do you remember any specific keywords or phrases from the message that we could search for?\n3. Would you like me to extend the search to a broader date range?\n4. Should we try searching your email inbox instead of messages, in case the communication was via email?\n\nPlease provide me with more information, and I'll be happy to help you search again with the updated details.",
