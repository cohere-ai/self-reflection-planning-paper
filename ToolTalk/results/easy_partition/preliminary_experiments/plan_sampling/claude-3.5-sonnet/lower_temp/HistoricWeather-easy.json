                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a discrepancy between your perception of the temperature and the actual weather conditions in London today. Let me clarify the situation for you:\n\n1. Current Weather: According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\"\n\n2. Historical Context: Looking at the historical weather data for September in London:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nGiven this information, I can address your question:\n\n1. It's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) today in London. The current high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warm for London, but not as extreme as you perceived.\n\n2. While today's temperature (80\u00b0F/27\u00b0C) is above the average September high (66\u00b0F/19\u00b0C), it's not unprecedented. It's warmer than usual, but still below the record high of 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) for September.\n\n3. It's normal to feel that it's unusually hot, as the current temperature is indeed above average for this time of year in London.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London in September, but it's also not as hot as you initially thought. The current temperature, while above average, is within the range of what can occur in London during this month.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly warm, it might be due to factors like humidity, lack of air conditioning (which is less common in London than in some other cities), or simply being in a particularly warm spot in the city. Remember to stay hydrated and seek shade or cool areas if you're feeling uncomfortable in the heat.",
