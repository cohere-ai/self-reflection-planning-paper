Here are the steps I took to try to find the message:\n\n1. I searched for messages containing \"new project\" from your boss sent between September 4th and September 11th.\n2. When that didn't yield results, I broadened the search to just \"project\" from your boss without date restrictions.\n3. Finally, I checked your email inbox for any emails containing \"project\" sent last week.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these searches returned any results. There could be a few reasons for this:\n\n1. The message might have been sent earlier than last week.\n2. The message might not contain the word \"project\" or might use different terminology.\n3. Your boss might have used a different communication method.\n4. There might be an issue with the message search or email system.\n\nTo help you find the message, I suggest:\n\n1. Try to remember any specific words or phrases your boss used in the message. We could search for those instead.\n2. Check if the message might have been sent earlier than last week.\n3. Consider other platforms where your boss might have communicated this information (e.g., a project management tool, company intranet, etc.).\n4. If you remember who else was included in the message, we could try searching for messages from them.\n\nWould you like to try another search with different keywords or parameters?",
