However, before proceeding, I want to make sure you understand that this action is permanent and cannot be undone. All your data associated with the account will be lost. Are you sure you want to go ahead with deleting your account?\n\nIf you're certain about deleting your account, I can guide you through the process. But first, I'll need to confirm that you're logged in and then assist you with the account deletion. Here's the plan I propose:\n\nStep 1: Check if the user is logged in by retrieving account information.\n#V1 = GetAccountInformation[]\n\nStep 2: If logged in, proceed with account deletion.\n#V2 = DeleteAccount[password=<user's password>]\n\nBefore I execute this plan, I need to confirm two things:\n\n1. Are you absolutely sure you want to delete your account?\n2. Can you please provide your account password to authorize the deletion?\n\nPlease note that I cannot proceed without your explicit confirmation and your account password. Your security and privacy are important, so I need to ensure that you are the account owner and that you genuinely want to take this irreversible action.",
