According to the current weather data, the high temperature in London today (September 11, 2023) is 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\" This is significantly cooler than the over 100\u00b0F (about 38\u00b0C) that you mentioned.\n\nTo address your question about whether it's normally this hot in London:\n\n1. The current high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is actually warmer than usual for September in London.\n2. According to historical weather data for September in London:\n   - The average maximum temperature is 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nSo, while today is warmer than average, it's not as extreme as you perceived, and it's still below the record high for September in London.\n\nIt's worth noting that temperatures over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) are extremely rare in London. The city's all-time record high temperature is 104.4\u00b0F (40.2\u00b0C), which was recorded in July 2022 during an exceptional heatwave.\n\nIf you're feeling unusually hot, it could be due to factors like:\n1. Humidity, which can make it feel warmer than the actual temperature\n2. Urban heat island effect, where cities can be warmer than surrounding areas\n3. Personal factors like health, activity level, or clothing\n\nIs it possible you might be experiencing any of these factors, or perhaps you're in a particularly warm spot in the city?",
