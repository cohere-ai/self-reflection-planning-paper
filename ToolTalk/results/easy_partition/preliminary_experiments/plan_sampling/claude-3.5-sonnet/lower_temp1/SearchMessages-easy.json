There might be an issue with the message retrieval system.\n\nTo help you find the message, I suggest we try a few more approaches:\n\n1. Let's search for messages from last week without specifying a sender.\n2. Then, we can try expanding the search to include the week before last.\n3. Finally, we can try searching your emails instead of messages, in case the communication was via email.\n\nLet's start with searching messages from last week without specifying a sender:\n\n",
