For security reasons, I can't see or store your password, so you'll need to enter it directly when using the tool.\n\nAre you ready to proceed with the login? If so, please use the UserLogin tool with your username \"justinkool\" and your password. If you prefer, you can just tell me that you're ready, and I'll provide the function call format for you to fill in with your password.",
