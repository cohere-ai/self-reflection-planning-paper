Day after tomorrow (2023-09-13):\n   - High: 67\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 60% chance of rain\n\n3. Two days from now (2023-09-14):\n   - High: 67\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 53\u00b0F (12\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 30% chance of rain\n\nBased on this forecast, it looks like the rain is expected to continue for at least two days with a high chance (60%) of rain. On the third day, the chance of rain decreases to 30%, which suggests the weather might be improving.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The rain is likely to continue for at least two days (September 12th and 13th).\n- There's a possibility of rain on the third day (September 14th) as well, but the chance is lower.\n\nKeep in mind that weather forecasts can change, so it might be a good idea to check again closer to the date for the most up-to-date information.",
