                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a misunderstanding about the current weather conditions in London. Let me clarify the situation based on the information I've gathered:\n\n1. Current Weather: According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\"\n\n2. Historical Weather: Looking at the historical weather data for September in London, we can see that:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - The average minimum temperature is around 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nGiven this information, I can address your concerns:\n\n1. It's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) today in London. The high temperature of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warm for London, but not as extreme as you thought.\n\n2. While today's temperature (80\u00b0F/27\u00b0C) is higher than the average September high (66\u00b0F/19\u00b0C), it's not unprecedented. The record high for September in London is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).\n\n3. It's unusual for London to experience temperatures over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) at any time of the year. Such extreme temperatures would be highly exceptional for this location.\n\nTo directly answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London, even in September. Today's temperature is above average but not as extreme as you initially thought. The perception of heat can sometimes feel more intense than the actual temperature, especially if you're not used to it or if it's particularly humid.\n\nIf you're feeling uncomfortably warm, it might be helpful to stay hydrated, seek shade or air-conditioned spaces, and avoid strenuous activities during the hottest parts of the day. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
