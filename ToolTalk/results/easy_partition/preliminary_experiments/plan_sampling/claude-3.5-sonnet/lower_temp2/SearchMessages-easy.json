I tried searching for messages with the keywords \"new project\" and also for any messages from your boss within the last week, but no results were returned. \n\nThere could be a few reasons for this:\n\n1. The message might have been sent earlier than last week.\n2. Your boss might have used different terms to describe the project.\n3. There might be an issue with the message search function.\n\nTo help you find the message, I have a few suggestions:\n\n1. Can you remember any specific words or phrases your boss used in the message? This could help us refine the search.\n2. Do you recall if the message was sent earlier than last week? If so, we could expand the search timeframe.\n3. Are you sure the message was sent as a direct message and not as an email? We might need to search your email inbox instead.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to try any of these options or if you have any other details that could help in finding the message.",
