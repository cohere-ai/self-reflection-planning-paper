According to the current weather data I just retrieved, it's actually not as hot as you described. Let me provide you with the accurate information and then we can discuss whether this is normal for London.\n\nCurrent weather in London:\n- Date: 2023-09-11 (today)\n- High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n- Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n- Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\nThe current high temperature of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is quite warm for London, but it's not over 100\u00b0F as you mentioned. It's possible you might be feeling warmer due to other factors like humidity or lack of air conditioning, which is common in many London buildings.\n\nTo answer your question about whether this is normal, let's check the historical weather data for London in September.\n\n",

                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a misunderstanding about the current weather conditions in London. Let me clarify the situation based on the information I've gathered:\n\n1. Current Weather: According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy.\"\n\n2. Historical Weather: Looking at the historical weather data for September in London, the average maximum temperature is typically around 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C), with a record high of 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C).\n\nGiven this information, I can address your concerns:\n\n1. It's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) today in London. The current high is 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C), which is warm for London but not as extreme as you thought.\n\n2. While 80\u00b0F is warmer than the average September high of 66\u00b0F, it's not unprecedented. The record high for September in London is 89\u00b0F.\n\n3. It is indeed warmer than usual for this time of year in London, but not to the extreme you initially thought.\n\nTo answer your question directly: No, it's not normally this warm in London in September, but it's also not as hot as you initially perceived. Today's temperature is above average but within the realm of possibility for a warm September day in London.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London or how it compares to typical conditions?",
