Let me explain the process for changing your password and why the current password is needed:\n\n1. The current password is required as a security measure to verify that you are the rightful owner of the account before making any changes.\n\n2. This is a standard practice in most systems to prevent unauthorized password changes.\n\n3. We never store or see your actual password. The system securely compares the entered password with the stored encrypted version.\n\nTo change your password, we'll use the ChangePassword tool, which requires both the old password and the new password you want to set. This ensures that only someone who knows the current password can make changes to the account.\n\nIf you're comfortable proceeding, you can provide your current password, and then we'll ask for your new password. If you prefer not to share your password verbally, there might be a self-service option on the website or app where you can change your password directly.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the password change process, or would you like to proceed with changing your password?",
