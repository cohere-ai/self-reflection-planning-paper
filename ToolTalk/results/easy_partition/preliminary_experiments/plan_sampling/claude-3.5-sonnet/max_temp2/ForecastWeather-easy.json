Day after tomorrow (2023-09-13): 60% chance of rain\n3. Third day (2023-09-14): 30% chance of rain\n\nIt looks like the rainy conditions are expected to persist for at least the next two days, with a higher chance of rain (60%) on both tomorrow and the day after. The chance of rain decreases to 30% on the third day.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The rain is likely to continue for at least 2 days.\n- There's a significant chance of rain for 2 days (60% each day).\n- On the third day, the chance of rain decreases, but there's still a possibility (30%).\n\nIt's worth noting that weather forecasts can change, so it might be a good idea to check again closer to the date if you have any outdoor plans.
