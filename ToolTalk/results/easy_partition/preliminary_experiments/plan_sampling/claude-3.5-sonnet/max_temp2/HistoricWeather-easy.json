                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a misunderstanding about the current weather conditions in London. Let me clarify the situation based on the information I've gathered:\n\n1. Current weather in London:\n   The current weather report for London shows a high of 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C) and a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C) for today, September 11, 2023. The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy\".\n\n2. Historical weather for September in London:\n   Typically, September in London has the following temperature ranges:\n   - Average minimum temperature: 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Average maximum temperature: 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - Record minimum temperature: 40\u00b0F (about 4\u00b0C)\n   - Record maximum temperature: 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nBased on this information, I can address your concerns:\n\n1. It's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) in London today. The high temperature is reported to be 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C), which is warm for London but not as extreme as you thought.\n\n2. While 80\u00b0F is warmer than the average maximum temperature for September (66\u00b0F), it's not unprecedented. The record high for September in London is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).\n\n3. Today's temperature, while above average, is not abnormally hot for London. It's within the range of temperatures that can occur in September, albeit on the warmer side.\n\nTo directly answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London in September, but today's temperature, while above average, is not as extreme as you initially thought. The current temperature is warm for London standards but not unprecedented or record-breaking.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly warm, it might be due to factors like humidity, lack of air conditioning (which is less common in London compared to some other cities), or simply being more sensitive to the heat than usual. Remember to stay hydrated and seek cool areas if you're feeling uncomfortable in the warmth.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
