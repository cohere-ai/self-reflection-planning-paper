    "scenario": "The user wants to delete their account because they forgot their password and cannot access it. They first try to reset their password by providing their username and email to the SendVerificationCode API. They receive a verification code in their email, but they realize that they also forgot their email password. They give up on resetting their password and decide to delete their account instead. They use the QueryUser API to find their account information using their username. They see that they have an alternative phone number registered with their account. They call the phone number and ask the person who answers to help them delete their account. The person agrees and logs in with their own username and password (UserLogin). They then use the UpdateAccountInformation API to change the email and phone number of the user's account to their own. They then use the DeleteAccount API to delete the user's account by providing the session token and password. They receive a confirmation message that the account has been deleted successfully.",

You should now be able to log in to your account with your username 'mstein' and your new password 'steinkymonkey'.\n\nFor your account's security, I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. Log in to your account and check if any information has been changed without your knowledge.\n2. Enable two-factor authentication if it's available.\n3. Change your password on any other accounts where you might have used the same password.\n4. Be cautious of any suspicious emails or messages you might have received recently, as they could be related to the hack.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding your account security?",
