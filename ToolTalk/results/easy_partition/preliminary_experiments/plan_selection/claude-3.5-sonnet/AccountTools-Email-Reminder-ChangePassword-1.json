Instead, when you're ready, you can replace \"$CURRENT_PASSWORD\" with your actual current password, and \"$NEW_PASSWORD\" with your desired new password.\n\nFor example, if your current password is \"OldPass123\" and you want to change it to \"NewSecurePass456\", you would do:\n\nStep 1: UserLogin[username=\"lifeng\", password=\"OldPass123\"]\nStep 2: ChangePassword[old_password=\"OldPass123\", new_password=\"NewSecurePass456\"]\n\nAre you ready to proceed with changing your password?
