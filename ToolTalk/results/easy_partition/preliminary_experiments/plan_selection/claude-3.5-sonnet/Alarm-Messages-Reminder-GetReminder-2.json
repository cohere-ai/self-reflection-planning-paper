They see that the reminder has a due date of tomorrow, which is the day of the exam. They decide to complete the reminder today and mark it as done (CompleteReminder). They then use a note-taking app to access their notes and a quiz app to practice the exercises. They spend two hours studying and then take a break. They send a message to their study group to ask how they are doing and share some tips (SendMessage). They also search for messages from their instructor to see if there are any updates or clarifications on the exam (SearchMessages). They then set an alarm for the next morning to wake up early and review the notes one more time (AddAlarm).",

Marked both of your reminders as complete:\n   - The reminder to \"Review exam notes\" (ID: 12-949b) has been marked as complete.\n   - The reminder to \"Practice exercises\" (ID: e3-793f) has also been marked as complete.\n\nBoth actions were successful. The alarm will go off in two hours, reminding you to finish up your exam review and exercise practice. Is there anything else you need help with?",
