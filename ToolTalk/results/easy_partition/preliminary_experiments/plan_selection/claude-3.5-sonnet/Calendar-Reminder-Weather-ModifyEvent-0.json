They see that it will be sunny and warm, so they decide to add a reminder to pack sunscreen and sunglasses (AddReminder). They also want to see if there are any historic weather records for New York on the same dates as their trip (HistoricWeather). They find out that there was a heat wave two years ago, so they decide to modify their event to include a note about staying hydrated (ModifyEvent).

Here's a breakdown of the typical September weather in New York:\n\n1. Average high temperature: 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n2. Average low temperature: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n3. Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n4. Record low temperature: 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C)\n\nThe forecast for your trip shows temperatures ranging from 72\u00b0F to 93\u00b0F (22\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C), which is significantly warmer than the historical average. In fact, the predicted high of 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) is even above the record high temperature for September.\n\nThe average rainfall for September is about 2.13 inches, and it's not uncommon to have some rainy days. The forecast showing a 50% chance of rain on Friday (September 8th) is consistent with typical September weather patterns.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, New York is not normally this hot in September. The temperatures you're experiencing are unusually high compared to historical averages. This could be due to a heat wave or potentially reflect broader climate trends.\n\nRemember to stay hydrated, use sun protection, and be prepared for both hot weather and possible rain during your trip. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather or your trip preparations?",
