However, we'll need some more information from you to create the event properly. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Create the event using the information we have.\n\n#V1 = CreateEvent(\n    name=\"Beatles Concert\",\n    event_type=\"event\",\n    description=\"Attending a Beatles concert\",\n    start_time=\"2023-09-15 20:00:00\",  # Assuming a typical concert start time of 8 PM\n    end_time=\"2023-09-15 23:00:00\",    # Assuming a 3-hour duration\n    location=\"To be confirmed\"\n)\n\nNow, I'll explain the choices I made and what additional information we might need:\n\n1. Name: I've set it as \"Beatles Concert\".\n2. Event Type: I've set it as \"event\" since it's not a meeting.\n3. Description: I've added a basic description.\n4. Start Time: I've assumed the concert is this Friday (September 15, 2023) at 8 PM. We'll need to confirm this.\n5. End Time: I've assumed a 3-hour duration, ending at 11 PM. This might need adjustment.\n6. Location: I've set it as \"To be confirmed\" because we don't know the venue yet.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust any of these details. Specifically, it would be helpful if you could provide:\n\n1. The exact start time of the concert\n2. The expected duration or end time\n3. The venue or location of the concert\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can update the event for you. Would you like to provide these details now?",
