The current high of 85\u00b0F is close to the typical maximum temperature for the month, while the low of 72\u00b0F is significantly higher than the average minimum.\n\nInterestingly, San Francisco has experienced some extreme temperatures in September historically, with a record high of 102\u00b0F and a record low of 48\u00b0F. However, such extremes are rare.\n\nSeptember is generally a dry month in San Francisco, with an average rainfall of only 3 inches. As expected, there are typically no snow days in September.\n\nThis information could form the basis of an interesting blog post about San Francisco's climate, perhaps focusing on how September weather typically marks a transition from the city's famous foggy summers to its clearer, warmer fall season.",
