Friday, September 15:\n   - High temperature: 61\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 60% chance of rain\n\n2. Saturday, September 16:\n   - High temperature: 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Cloudy\n\n3. Sunday, September 17:\n   - High temperature: 64\u00b0F (18\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 44\u00b0F (7\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Light rain\n\nBased on this forecast, it looks like you can expect a mix of weather conditions in Edinburgh this weekend:\n\n- Friday has a good chance of rain, so you might want to pack an umbrella or raincoat.\n- Saturday will be cloudy but likely dry, which could be good for outdoor activities.\n- Sunday will have the warmest high temperature but also a chance of light rain.\n\nOverall, the temperatures will be mild, ranging from the mid-40s to mid-60s Fahrenheit (about 7-18\u00b0C). It's a good idea to pack layers and be prepared for some rain. Don't forget to bring a waterproof jacket and comfortable, water-resistant shoes.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about your trip to Edinburgh this weekend?",
