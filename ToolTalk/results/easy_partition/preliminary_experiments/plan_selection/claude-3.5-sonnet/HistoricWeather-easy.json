Let me provide you with the correct information and then we can look into whether this is normal for London.\n\nThe current weather in London shows:\n- High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n- Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n- Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\nThis is significantly cooler than the 100\u00b0F (about 38\u00b0C) you mentioned. It's possible that you might be feeling warmer due to other factors like humidity or lack of air circulation, but the actual temperature is much lower.\n\nTo answer your question about whether this is normal for London, let's check the historical weather data for this time of year. I'll use the HistoricWeather tool to get this information.\n\n",

                    "text": "\n\nI apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's a discrepancy between your perception of the temperature and the actual weather conditions in London. Let me clarify the situation for you:\n\n1. Current Weather: According to the current weather data for London, the high temperature today (September 11, 2023) is actually 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C), with a low of 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C). The conditions are described as \"Mostly Cloudy\".\n\n2. Historical Weather: Looking at the historical weather data for September in London, we can see that:\n   - The average maximum temperature is around 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - The average minimum temperature is around 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - The record high temperature for September is 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n\nGiven this information, I can address your question:\n\n1. It's not actually over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) today. The current high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warm for London, but not as extreme as you perceived.\n\n2. Today's temperature (80\u00b0F/27\u00b0C) is indeed higher than the average September high (66\u00b0F/19\u00b0C) in London, but it's not unprecedented. It falls within the range of temperatures that London can experience in September, though it's closer to the record high than the average.\n\n3. While it's warmer than usual, it's not abnormally hot for London in September. The city can occasionally experience temperatures in this range, especially with global warming trends.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: No, it's not normally this hot in London, but today's temperature, while above average, is not as extreme as you initially thought. It's a warm day for London standards, but not extraordinarily hot. The perception of heat can sometimes be influenced by factors like humidity, lack of air conditioning (which is common in London), or simply being unaccustomed to warmer temperatures.\n\nIf you're feeling uncomfortably warm, it might be helpful to stay hydrated, seek shade or air-conditioned spaces, and wear light, breathable clothing. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in London?",
