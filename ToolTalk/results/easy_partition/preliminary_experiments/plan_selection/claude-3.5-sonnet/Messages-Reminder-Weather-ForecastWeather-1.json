New York: The temperature will drop considerably over the next few days, from 90\u00b0F today to 75\u00b0F on 2023-09-10. This is a decrease of 15\u00b0F, which might result in you using different colors for your temperature blanket.\n\n2. Tokyo: Interestingly, Tokyo's temperature will increase sharply tomorrow, jumping from 80\u00b0F today to 92\u00b0F. It will remain hot for a couple of days before cooling slightly to 85\u00b0F on 2023-09-11.\n\nThese changes should definitely give you some variety in your temperature blankets for both cities in the coming days. The colors you use for New York should shift to represent cooler temperatures, while Tokyo's colors will likely shift to represent much warmer temperatures.",

I found one existing reminder with the ID '0b-5119' set for September 30th to \"buy more yarn\". As per your request, I've deleted this reminder.\n\nTo summarize:\n1. Added a new reminder: \"Buy more yarn\" for tomorrow (September 9th) at 9:00 AM.\n2. Deleted an existing reminder: \"buy more yarn\" that was set for September 30th.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do regarding your reminders or yarn purchases?",
