They see that the data is incomplete and only has 10 records. They use SearchMessages to look for any messages from their teacher with the query \"weather\". They see that they have a message from two days ago that says they can use any online source for the data. They use SendMessage to thank their teacher and ask for some recommendations. They get a reply with a link to a website that has more data. They use GetReminders to see if they have any reminders for the project. They see that they have one with the task \"Submit weather project\" and the due_date set to next Monday. They use DeleteReminder to delete the reminder and create a new one with the same task and due_date, but with a note that says \"Use website for data\".",

The tools available to me don't offer that level of detailed historical data. However, I can provide you with some relevant information that might be helpful for your project:\n\n1. Current Weather in New York (as of September 11, 2023):\n   - High temperature: 78\u00b0F (26\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Sunny\n\n2. Historic Weather Information for September in New York:\n   - Average minimum temperature: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Average maximum temperature: 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n   - Record low temperature: 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n   - Average rainfall: 2.13 inches (54 mm)\n   - Snow days: 0\n\nWhile this doesn't give you the year-by-year breakdown you were looking for, it does provide some context for September weather patterns in New York. The current day's temperature (high of 78\u00b0F) is actually warmer than the average maximum temperature for September (66\u00b0F), which could be an interesting point to note in your project.\n\nFor your AP Environmental Science project, you might want to consider:\n\n1. Comparing today's temperature to the average and record temperatures for September.\n2. Discussing the factors that might contribute to temperature variations in New York during September.\n3. Exploring how climate change might be affecting temperature patterns in the region.\n\nIf you need more specific historical data, I'd recommend checking with local weather stations, the National Weather Service, or climate data repositories that might have more detailed records for your analysis. These sources often have databases that can provide daily temperature records going back several decades.\n\nIs there any other weather-related information I can help you with for your project?",
