This could help us search more accurately.\n3. Is it possible the message was sent earlier than two weeks ago? If so, we could expand our search timeframe.\n4. Would you like me to search your emails instead of messages? Sometimes important information is communicated via email rather than internal messaging systems.\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll be happy to help you search again with any additional information you can provide.",
