It's scheduled from 2023-09-11 14:00:00 to 2023-09-11 15:00:00\n3. The location is listed as \"online\"\n4. The attendees are you (justinkool) and someone with the username 'salcano'\n\nThe meeting hasn't been cancelled according to your calendar. Since it's currently 14:15, the meeting started about 15 minutes ago. It's possible that the other person (Hugo) is running late or having technical difficulties joining the online meeting.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. Double-check the meeting link or platform to ensure you're in the right place.\n2. Wait a few more minutes, as sometimes people can be slightly delayed.\n3. If Hugo doesn't show up soon, you might want to reach out to them directly.\n\nWould you like me to help you send a message to Hugo (assuming 'salcano' is Hugo's username) to check on their status?",
