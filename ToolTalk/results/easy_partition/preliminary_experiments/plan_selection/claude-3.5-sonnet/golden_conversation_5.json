However, creating a new account may not be the best solution to address spam issues. Instead, I can suggest some alternatives that might help reduce the amount of spam you receive while keeping your current account. Here's what we can do:\n\n1. First, let's check if there are any account settings or filters we can adjust to reduce spam.\n2. If that doesn't work, we can consider changing your email address associated with this account.\n3. As a last resort, we can discuss creating a new account, but let's explore the other options first.\n\nLet's start by reviewing your current account information:\n\nYour current account details are:\n- Username: ahhchiu\n- Email: k.chiu@taoxi.edu\n- Phone: 806-361-3049\n- Name: Kong Chiu\n\nNow, here are some suggestions to help reduce spam:\n\n1. Check your email provider's spam filter settings. Make sure they're set to an appropriate level.\n2. Create email filters or rules to automatically move suspected spam to a separate folder.\n3. Be cautious about sharing your email address online or signing up for newsletters.\n4. Regularly unsubscribe from unwanted mailing lists.\n\nIf you've already tried these methods and still want to make changes to your account, we can update your email address. This might help reduce spam without the need to create an entirely new account. Would you like to update your email address? If so, I can guide you through the process of changing it.\n\nAlternatively, if you still prefer to create a new account, I can help you with that process as well. However, please note that creating a new account means you'll need to set up all your preferences, contacts, and other account-related information from scratch.\n\nWhat would you like to do? Would you prefer to:\n1. Update your current email address?\n2. Create a new account?\n3. Try other spam reduction methods first?\n\nPlease let me know which option you'd like to pursue, and I'll be happy to assist you further.",

Created a new account with the username \"ahhchiu_new\" (I used a placeholder email, name, and phone number which you should update later).\n2. Transferred your two events from October to the new account:\n   - Matt's Birthday on October 4th\n   - The Cave on October 31st\n3. Set up a new alarm for 8:00 AM on the new account.\n4. Deleted your old account (username: ahhchiu).\n\nYour new account is now set up with the events and alarm you wanted to keep. The username for your new account is \"ahhchiu_new\", and I've set a temporary password \"NewSecurePass123!\".\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do with your new account? For example, would you like to update your personal information or change the password?",
