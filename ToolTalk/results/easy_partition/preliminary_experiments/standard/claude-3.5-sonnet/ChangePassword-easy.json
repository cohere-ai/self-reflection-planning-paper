This function requires your current password and the new password you'd like to set. \n\nFor security reasons, I can't see or know your current password, so you'll need to provide that. Also, you'll need to choose a new password that you'd like to use.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. You'll need to provide your current password.\n2. You'll need to decide on a new password. Remember, it's important to choose a strong password that:\n   - Is at least 8 characters long\n   - Contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters\n   - Includes numbers and special characters\n   - Is not easily guessable (avoid common words or personal information)\n\nOnce you have both your current password and new password ready, I can help you make the change. \n\nAre you ready to proceed with changing your password? If so, please provide your current password and the new password you'd like to use. Remember, never share your passwords with anyone, including AI assistants. I'll use placeholders in my next message to protect your privacy.",

I asked for your current password because changing a password typically requires verifying the current password for security reasons. However, I should have explained the process more clearly.\n\nTo change your password, we'll need to use the ChangePassword function, which requires both your old password and the new password you want to set. This is a security measure to ensure that only the account owner can change the password.\n\nHere's how the process works:\n\n1. You'll need to provide your current password (for verification).\n2. You'll need to provide your new desired password.\n3. I'll use the ChangePassword function to update your password securely.\n\nRest assured, I don't store or see your password; it's processed securely by the system. If you're comfortable proceeding, you can provide your current password and the new password you'd like to set. If you prefer not to share your password here, you might want to use a secure account management page on the website instead.\n\nWould you like to proceed with changing your password, or would you prefer to explore other options for managing your account security?",
