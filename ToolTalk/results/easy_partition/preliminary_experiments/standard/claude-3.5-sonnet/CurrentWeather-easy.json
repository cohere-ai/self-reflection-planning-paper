Here's what the weather is like right now:\n\n- Date: September 11, 2023\n- High temperature: 78\u00b0F (about 26\u00b0C)\n- Low temperature: 60\u00b0F (about 16\u00b0C)\n- Conditions: Sunny\n\nThe weather is sunny with comfortable temperatures.

It should be very pleasant for a walk.\n\nHere are some recommendations for your walk:\n\n1. Wear comfortable, breathable clothing suitable for warm weather.\n2. Don't forget to apply sunscreen, as it's a sunny day.\n3. Bring a water bottle to stay hydrated.\n4. If you're sensitive to sun, consider wearing a hat or sunglasses.\n5. If you plan to be out for a while, the temperature might rise, so layering could be a good idea.\n\nEnjoy your walk in the beautiful New York weather!",
