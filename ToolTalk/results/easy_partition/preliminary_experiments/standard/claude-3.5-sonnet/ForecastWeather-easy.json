The temperature will range from 61\u00b0F (16\u00b0C) to 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C), which is quite mild. However, you should be prepared for wet weather as there's a 60% chance of rain.\n\nIt might be a good idea to have an umbrella or raincoat handy if you're planning to go out. Despite the rain, the temperatures are quite comfortable, so it shouldn't be too chilly.\n\nWould you like to know about the weather for the following days or any other information?",
