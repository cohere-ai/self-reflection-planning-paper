According to the current weather data I just retrieved, it's actually not as hot as you described. Let me provide you with the accurate information:\n\nThe current weather in London shows:\n- High temperature: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n- Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n- Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\nThis is quite different from the over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) you mentioned. While 80\u00b0F is warm for London, it's not unusually hot for a summer day.\n\nTo answer your question about whether it's normally this hot in London, let's check the historical weather data for September:\n\n",

                    "text": "\n\nI apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in your perception of the current temperature. According to the current weather data for London, it's actually much cooler than you thought. Let me provide you with the accurate information:\n\n1. Current weather: \n   - Today's high: 80\u00b0F (about 27\u00b0C)\n   - Today's low: 56\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Mostly Cloudy\n\n2. Historic weather for September in London:\n   - Average high: 66\u00b0F (about 19\u00b0C)\n   - Average low: 55\u00b0F (about 13\u00b0C)\n   - Record high: 89\u00b0F (about 32\u00b0C)\n   - Record low: 40\u00b0F (about 4\u00b0C)\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, it's not normally over 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) in London, and it's not that hot today either. In fact, today's high of 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C) is warmer than the average September high (66\u00b0F/19\u00b0C), but it's still well below 100\u00b0F.\n\nLondon generally has a temperate climate and rarely experiences extreme heat. Even the record high for September is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C), which is significantly lower than 100\u00b0F.\n\nIf you're feeling unusually warm, it could be due to factors like:\n1. Direct sunlight\n2. Lack of air circulation\n3. Physical activity\n4. Humidity (which can make it feel warmer than the actual temperature)\n\nRemember to stay hydrated and seek shade if you're feeling too warm. If you're concerned about the heat, you might want to check your local indoor temperature or consult a thermometer for a more accurate reading.",
