They see that they have a reminder to pay their rent by the end of the month, and they decide to do it right away (CompleteReminder). They also see that they have an event for a birthday party on the weekend, and they want to buy a gift for the host. They add a reminder to order a gift online by Friday (AddReminder). They then send a message to the host to RSVP and ask for their address (SendMessage).",
