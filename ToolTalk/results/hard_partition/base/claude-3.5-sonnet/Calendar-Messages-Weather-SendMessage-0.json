They see that it is snowing and the temperature is below freezing. They then check the forecast for the next 3 days using ForecastWeather. They see that the snow will continue and the temperature will remain low. They decide that it is a good time to go skiing and create an event on their calendar using CreateEvent. They set the event type to 'event', the name to 'Ski Trip', the description to 'A fun weekend at the ski resort', the start time to '2021-01-15 08:00:00', the end time to '2021-01-17 18:00:00', and the location to 'Snowy Mountain Resort'. They then invite their friends to the event by adding their usernames to the attendees parameter. They also send a message to their friends using SendMessage to let them know about the event and ask them to confirm their attendance. They wait for their friends to reply and check their messages using SearchMessages with the query 'Ski Trip' and the sender as their username.",

There's a chance of snow on all three days, which is great for skiing. The temperatures are cold enough for snow, especially on the 12th and 14th. \n\nThe 13th seems to be a bit warmer, which might lead to softer snow conditions. This could be good for beginners but might not be ideal if you prefer harder-packed snow.\n\nWould you like me to help you plan the trip further? I can assist with creating a calendar event, sending messages to Annie and Charlie, or looking for accommodations near Mont Blanc.",
