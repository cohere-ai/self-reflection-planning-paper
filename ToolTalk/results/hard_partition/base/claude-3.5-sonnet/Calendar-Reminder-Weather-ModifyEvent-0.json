They also want to check the weather forecast for New York for the next 3 days (ForecastWeather). They see that it will be sunny and warm, so they decide to add a reminder to pack sunscreen and sunglasses (AddReminder). They also want to see if there are any historic weather records for New York on the same dates as their trip (HistoricWeather). They find out that there was a heat wave two years ago, so they decide to modify their event to include a note about staying hydrated (ModifyEvent). They also want to invite their friends to the event, so they add their usernames as attendees (ModifyEvent).",

Here's a breakdown of the typical September weather in New York:\n\n1. Average temperatures:\n   - Minimum: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Maximum: 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n\n2. Record temperatures:\n   - Record low: 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C)\n   - Record high: 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n\n3. Average rainfall: 2.13 inches (54 mm)\n4. Snow days: 0\n\nThe forecast for your trip shows temperatures ranging from 72\u00b0F to 93\u00b0F (22\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C), which is significantly warmer than the typical September weather. The high of 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) is even above the record high temperature for September.\n\nThis unusually warm weather could be due to a heat wave or changing climate patterns. It's good that you're packing sunscreen, as the temperatures are more typical of summer than early fall in New York.\n\nRemember that weather can be variable, so it's always a good idea to check the forecast again closer to your departure date.
