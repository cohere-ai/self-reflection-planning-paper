Today's weather is on the warmer side compared to the historic averages for September.\n2. San Francisco's September weather can vary quite a bit, with a 40\u00b0F (22\u00b0C) difference between the average low and high temperatures.\n3. The record high of 102\u00b0F (39\u00b0C) is quite extreme for San Francisco, which is known for its mild climate.\n4. September is typically a dry month in San Francisco, with only about 3 inches of rain on average.\n5. The city's famous fog (often called \"Karl the Fog\" by locals) isn't reflected in these numbers but could be an interesting point to discuss in your blog.\n\nRemember, you have about 50 minutes left before your blog post submission deadline at 10:00 AM.
