They find one email from the organizer confirming the cancellation and another email from a colleague asking for some feedback on a report (SearchInbox). They reply to the organizer with a polite message (SendEmail) and open the report attachment from the colleague. They decide to add a new reminder to review the report later (AddReminder). They then go to their list of reminders (GetReminders) and find the reminder for the cancelled meeting. They delete the reminder (DeleteReminder) and check the current weather (CurrentWeather) to see if they can go for a walk.",

Calendar check: I checked your calendar for today (September 12, 2023), and I found one event:\n   - Event: Fly to Paris\n   - Start time: 2023-09-12 10:00:00\n   - End time: 2023-09-13 04:00:00\n\nIt seems that you have a flight to Paris scheduled, which starts at 10:00 AM today and ends at 4:00 AM tomorrow. This event might be conflicting with the meeting you mentioned.\n\nGiven this information, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. The meeting about team goals might not be in your calendar or email yet.\n2. The meeting might have been scheduled for a different day.\n3. There might have been a miscommunication about the meeting time or date.\n\nTo get more information, you could:\n\n1. Check with your colleagues or team leader about the meeting details.\n2. Search your emails or calendar for a broader time range or with different keywords.\n3. If you're certain about the meeting, consider reaching out to the organizer to confirm the details, especially given your flight to Paris.\n\nWould you like me to perform any additional searches or checks for you?",
