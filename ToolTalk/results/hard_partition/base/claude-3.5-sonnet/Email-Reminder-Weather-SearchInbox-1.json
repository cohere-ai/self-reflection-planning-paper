Saturday, September 16:\n   - High: 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 56\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Cloudy\n\n3. Sunday, September 17:\n   - High: 64\u00b0F (18\u00b0C)\n   - Low: 44\u00b0F (7\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Light rain\n\nOverall, it looks like you can expect a mix of weather conditions in Edinburgh this weekend. Friday has a good chance of rain, so you might want to pack an umbrella or raincoat. Saturday will be cloudy but likely dry, while Sunday may have some light rain.\n\nTemperatures will be relatively mild, with highs around 60-64\u00b0F (16-18\u00b0C) and lows between 44-56\u00b0F (7-13\u00b0C). It's a good idea to bring layers, as it might feel chilly, especially in the evenings or when it's raining.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about your trip to Edinburgh?",
