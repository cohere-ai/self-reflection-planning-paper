    "scenario": "The user wants to send an email to their colleague with some feedback on their presentation (SendEmail). They first watch the presentation video and take some notes. They then write an email with their feedback and suggestions. They also want to add a reminder to follow up with their colleague in a week (AddReminder). They then send the email (SendEmail). They then want to see if they have any other pending tasks, so they get a list of their reminders (GetReminders). They see that they have a reminder to complete a survey that is due today. They click on the link in the reminder and complete the survey. They then mark the reminder as complete (CompleteReminder). They also want to see how the weather has changed since they started working from home, so they query the historic weather data for the past month (HistoricWeather).",

I've had a chance to review it, and I have some feedback for you:\n\nOverall, it's mostly good. However, I have two main suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Pace: Try to speak a bit slower. This will help your audience better absorb the information you're presenting.\n\n2. Slide content: Consider reducing the number of words on your slides. This will make them easier to read and will keep the audience focused on what you're saying rather than trying to read dense text.\n\nThese adjustments should help make your presentation even more effective. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.\n\nBest regards,\nLi Feng",
