Since it's an online meeting and the other person (Hugo, with username 'salcano') hasn't shown up yet, there could be a few possibilities:\n\n1. They might be running a few minutes late.\n2. They might have forgotten about the meeting.\n3. There could be some technical issues on their end.\n\nTo get more information, you could:\n\n1. Wait a few more minutes to see if they join.\n2. Check your email or messages to see if they've sent any communication about being late or needing to reschedule.\n3. Send a quick message to check if everything is okay.\n\nWould you like me to help you send a message to Hugo (salcano) to check on the status of the meeting?",
