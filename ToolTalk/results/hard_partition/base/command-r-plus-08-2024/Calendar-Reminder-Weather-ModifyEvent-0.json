They also want to check the weather forecast for New York for the next 3 days (ForecastWeather). They see that it will be sunny and warm, so they decide to add a reminder to pack sunscreen and sunglasses (AddReminder). They also want to see if there are any historic weather records for New York on the same dates as their trip (HistoricWeather). They find out that there was a heat wave two years ago, so they decide to modify their event to include a note about staying hydrated (ModifyEvent). They also want to invite their friends to the event, so they add their usernames as attendees (ModifyEvent).",
