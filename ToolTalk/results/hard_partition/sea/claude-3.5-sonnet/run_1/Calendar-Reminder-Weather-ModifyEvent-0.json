They find out that there was a heat wave two years ago, so they decide to modify their event to include a note about staying hydrated (ModifyEvent).

The reminder is set for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, giving you plenty of time to prepare before your trip on Friday.\n\nYou're right about the weather. It's going to be quite warm, with temperatures reaching up to 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) on Thursday and 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) on Friday. There's also a 50% chance of rain on Friday, the day you're leaving, so it's good to be prepared with both sun protection and rain gear.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do to help you prepare for your trip?",

Here's a breakdown of the typical September weather in New York:\n\n1. Average high temperature: 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n2. Average low temperature: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n3. Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n4. Record low temperature: 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C)\n\nThe forecast for your trip shows temperatures significantly above these averages:\n- September 7: High of 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C)\n- September 8: High of 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n- September 9: High of 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C)\n\nThese temperatures are closer to (and even exceeding) the record high for September in New York. So, to answer your question: No, New York is not normally this hot in September. The temperatures you're experiencing are unusually high for this time of year.\n\nThe average rainfall for September in New York is about 2.13 inches (54 mm), spread throughout the month. The forecast showing a 50% chance of rain on September 8th (the day of your arrival) is not unusual, as some rain is expected in September.\n\nGiven these unusually high temperatures, it's good that you're packing sunscreen. The umbrella is also a wise choice for the potential rain. You might also want to pack light, breathable clothing to stay comfortable in the heat.",
