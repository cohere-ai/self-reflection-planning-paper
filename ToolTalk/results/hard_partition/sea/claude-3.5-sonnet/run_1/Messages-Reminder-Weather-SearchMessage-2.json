They see that the data is incomplete and only has 10 records. They use SearchMessages to look for any messages from their teacher with the query \"weather\". They see that they have a message from two days ago that says they can use any online source for the data. They use SendMessage to thank their teacher and ask for some recommendations. They get a reply with a link to a website that has more data. They use GetReminders to see if they have any reminders for the project. They see that they have one with the task \"Submit weather project\" and the due_date set to next Monday. They use DeleteReminder to delete the reminder and create a new one with the same task and due_date, but with a note that says \"Use website for data\".",

The historic weather tool I have access to only provides monthly averages, not daily data over multiple years.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some general information about September weather in New York based on the data I retrieved:\n\n1. Average temperature range: The average temperature in New York in September typically ranges from a low of 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) to a high of 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C).\n\n2. Record temperatures: The record low temperature for September in New York is 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), while the record high is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).\n\n3. Rainfall: On average, New York receives about 2.13 inches (54 mm) of rainfall in September.\n\n4. Snow: September typically doesn't see any snow in New York.\n\nFor your AP Environmental Science project on weather patterns, you might want to consider the following:\n\n1. While I couldn't provide daily data over a decade, you could use this monthly data as a starting point to discuss general September weather patterns in New York.\n\n2. You could compare this September data to other months to show how the weather changes throughout the year in New York.\n\n3. To get more specific data for your project, you might need to consult other sources like the National Weather Service or local meteorological databases that can provide daily historical data over multiple years.\n\n4. You could also discuss how climate change might be affecting these averages over time, though that would require data from a longer period than just the last decade.\n\nIs there any other information about New York's weather that would be helpful for your project?",

Record Temperatures:\n   - Record low temperature: 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C)\n\n3. Precipitation:\n   - Average rainfall: 2.13 inches (54 mm)\n   - Snow days: 0 (September is typically too warm for snow in New York)\n\nThis data represents typical conditions for September in New York based on historical records. Keep in mind that these are averages and individual years can vary. The wide range between record low and high temperatures (40\u00b0F to 89\u00b0F) shows that September weather in New York can be quite variable.\n\nFor your AP Environmental Science project, you might want to consider how these averages compare to recent years, which could potentially show trends related to climate change. You could also look into how these September conditions compare to other months in New York to understand the city's seasonal patterns.\n\nIs there any specific aspect of this data you'd like to focus on for your project?",
