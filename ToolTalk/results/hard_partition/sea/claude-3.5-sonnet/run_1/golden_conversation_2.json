While you don't have a full hour free for a walk, you do have some time for a shorter break. Here's what I can tell you:\n\n1. You have approximately 40 minutes free before your next scheduled event.\n2. Your next event is a \"1 on 1 with Hugo\" meeting starting at 2:00 PM.\n\nGiven this information, you could potentially take a shorter walk or break. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. You could take a 30-minute walk, which would give you about 10 minutes to prepare for your upcoming meeting.\n2. You could take a 20-25 minute walk, which would allow for a more relaxed transition to your meeting.\n3. If you prefer to stay close to your workspace, you could take a 15-20 minute break for some stretching, meditation, or a short outdoor breather.\n\nRemember, it's important to be back and ready for your 2:00 PM meeting with Hugo. Would you like to take a shorter break, or would you prefer to find another time for a full hour-long walk?",
