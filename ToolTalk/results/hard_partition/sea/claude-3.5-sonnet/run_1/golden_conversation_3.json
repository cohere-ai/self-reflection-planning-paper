The meeting details are as follows:\n\n- Name: 1 on 1 with Hugo\n- Start time: 2023-09-11 14:00:00 (which is about 15 minutes ago)\n- End time: 2023-09-11 15:00:00\n- Location: online\n- Description: bi-weekly sync\n- Attendees: justinkool (you) and salcano (presumably Hugo)\n\nThe meeting hasn't been cancelled according to your calendar. However, since the other person (Hugo) hasn't shown up yet, it's possible that they might be running late or there might have been a miscommunication.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. Wait a few more minutes, as it's common for people to be slightly late to meetings.\n2. If Hugo doesn't join soon, you could try reaching out to them via a message or email to check if everything is okay.\n\nWould you like me to help you send a message or email to Hugo to inquire about the meeting?",
