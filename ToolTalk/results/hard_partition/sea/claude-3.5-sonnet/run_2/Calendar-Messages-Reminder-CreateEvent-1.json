They then send a message to the friend asking for their guest list (SendMessage). They receive a message from the friend with the names of the guests (SearchMessages). They then modify the event to add the guests as attendees (ModifyEvent). They then send a message to each guest inviting them to the party and asking for their RSVP (SendMessage).",
