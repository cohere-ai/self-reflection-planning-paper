Please proceed with the meeting as planned, and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could share the meeting notes with me afterwards.\n\nIf there are any crucial decisions or tasks that require my input, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email or message, and I'll respond as soon as I'm available.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\nJustin",
