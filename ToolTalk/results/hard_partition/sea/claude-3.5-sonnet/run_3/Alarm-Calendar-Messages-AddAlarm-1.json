They also use CreateEvent to add the flight details to their calendar, with the name, description, start_time, end_time, and location. They then use SearchMessages to look for the confirmation email from the airline, with the query \"flight\", sender \"airline@example.com\", and start_date and end_date as today's date. They find the email and check the flight number, boarding time, and gate number. They also use SendMessage to send a message to their friend who is picking them up at the destination, with the message containing their flight information and arrival time.",
