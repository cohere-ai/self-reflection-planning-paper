They see that it will be sunny and warm, so they decide to add a reminder to pack sunscreen and sunglasses (AddReminder). They also want to see if there are any historic weather records for New York on the same dates as their trip (HistoricWeather). They find out that there was a heat wave two years ago, so they decide to modify their event to include a note about staying hydrated (ModifyEvent). They also want to invite their friends to the event, so they add their usernames as attendees (ModifyEvent).",

This should give you enough time to pack these items before you leave.\n\nYou're right about the weather. It will be quite warm, with temperatures reaching up to 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) on Thursday and 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) on Friday. There's also a 50% chance of rain on Friday, so bringing an umbrella is a good idea.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do to help you prepare for your trip?",

Average temperatures for September in New York:\n   - Minimum: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Maximum: 66\u00b0F (19\u00b0C)\n\n2. Current forecast for your trip:\n   - Friday (Sept 8): High of 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C), Low of 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C)\n   - Saturday (Sept 9): High of 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C), Low of 73\u00b0F (23\u00b0C)\n\nAs you can see, the forecasted temperatures are significantly higher than the historical averages. The record high temperature for September in New York is 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C), and Friday's forecast is actually exceeding this record.\n\nIt's worth noting that while this is unusually warm, it's not entirely unprecedented. Climate change has been causing more frequent heat waves and record-breaking temperatures in many parts of the world.\n\nThe rainfall you're seeing in the forecast (50% chance on Friday) is not unusual, as the average rainfall for September in New York is about 2.13 inches.\n\nSo to answer your question: No, New York is not normally this hot in September. You're experiencing an unusually warm spell, which makes it even more important that you remembered to pack sunscreen!",
