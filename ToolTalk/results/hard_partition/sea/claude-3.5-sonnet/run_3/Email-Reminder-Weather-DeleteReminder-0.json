They find one email from the organizer confirming the cancellation and another email from a colleague asking for some feedback on a report (SearchInbox). They reply to the organizer with a polite message (SendEmail) and open the report attachment from the colleague. They decide to add a new reminder to review the report later (AddReminder). They then go to their list of reminders (GetReminders) and find the reminder for the cancelled meeting. They delete the reminder (DeleteReminder) and check the current weather (CurrentWeather) to see if they can go for a walk.",

I searched your email for messages related to \"meeting team goals 3pm\" and \"meeting team goals\" for today (September 12, 2023), but no relevant emails were found.\n\n2. I also checked your calendar for today, and I found one event:\n   - Event: Fly to Paris\n   - Start time: 2023-09-12 10:00:00\n   - End time: 2023-09-13 04:00:00\n\nThis event doesn't seem to be related to the meeting you're asking about. It appears you have a flight to Paris scheduled from 10 AM today until 4 AM tomorrow.\n\nGiven this information, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. The meeting might not have been added to your calendar or communicated via email.\n2. The meeting details might have been communicated through another channel (e.g., instant messaging, in-person conversation).\n3. There might be a miscommunication about the date or time of the meeting.\n\nWould you like me to search for meetings on a different date or with different keywords?
