Friday, September 15:\n   - High temperature: 61\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: 60% chance of rain\n\n2. Saturday, September 16:\n   - High temperature: 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 56\u00b0F (13\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Cloudy\n\n3. Sunday, September 17:\n   - High temperature: 64\u00b0F (18\u00b0C)\n   - Low temperature: 44\u00b0F (7\u00b0C)\n   - Conditions: Light rain\n\nOverall, it looks like you can expect a mix of weather conditions in Edinburgh this weekend. Friday has a good chance of rain, Saturday will be cloudy but likely dry, and Sunday might have some light rain. Temperatures will be mild, with highs in the low 60s Fahrenheit (around 16-18\u00b0C) and lows ranging from mid-40s to mid-50s Fahrenheit (about 7-13\u00b0C).\n\nGiven this forecast, I would recommend packing:\n1. A waterproof jacket or umbrella\n2. Layers for warmth, as temperatures may vary\n3. Comfortable, water-resistant shoes\n\nRemember that weather can change, so it's a good idea to check again closer to your travel date. Enjoy your trip to Edinburgh!",
