They see that the data is incomplete and only has 10 records. They use SearchMessages to look for any messages from their teacher with the query \"weather\". They see that they have a message from two days ago that says they can use any online source for the data. They use SendMessage to thank their teacher and ask for some recommendations. They get a reply with a link to a website that has more data. They use GetReminders to see if they have any reminders for the project. They see that they have one with the task \"Submit weather project\" and the due_date set to next Monday. They use DeleteReminder to delete the reminder and create a new one with the same task and due_date, but with a note that says \"Use website for data\".",

Record Temperatures:\n   - Record low temperature: 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C)\n   - Record high temperature: 102\u00b0F (39\u00b0C)\n\n3. Precipitation:\n   - Average rainfall: 3.0 inches (76.2 mm)\n   - Snow days: 0 (San Francisco typically doesn't get snow in September)\n\nThis data gives you a general idea of what to expect in San Francisco during September. The city experiences mild to warm temperatures, with a wide range between the minimum and maximum. It's worth noting that San Francisco's weather can be quite variable due to its unique microclimate, influenced by the bay and ocean.\n\nThe lack of snow days and relatively low average rainfall indicates that September is generally a dry month in San Francisco. However, some rain can occur, as shown by the average rainfall of 3 inches.\n\nIs there any specific aspect of this data you'd like me to elaborate on for your project?",
