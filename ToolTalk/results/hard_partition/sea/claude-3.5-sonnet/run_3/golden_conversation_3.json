It's scheduled for today (2023-09-11) from 14:00:00 to 15:00:00\n3. The location is listed as \"online\"\n4. The attendees are you (justinkool) and someone with the username 'salcano'\n\nThe meeting hasn't been cancelled according to your calendar. Since it's currently 14:15, the meeting started about 15 minutes ago. It's possible that the other person (Hugo, presumably) is running late or having technical difficulties.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. Double-check your meeting link or online meeting platform to ensure you're in the right place.\n2. Wait a few more minutes, as sometimes people can be slightly late to online meetings due to various reasons.\n3. If you'd like, we can try to reach out to Hugo to check on their status.\n\nWould you like me to help you send a message to Hugo (salcano) to check on the meeting status?",
